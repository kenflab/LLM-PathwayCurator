# Notebooks (archived)

These Jupyter notebooks were used for exploratory development and figure prototyping during the project.

**Canonical reproduction is script-based** and is provided in:
- [`paper/scripts/`](../scripts/) (entry-point scripts)
- [`paper/FIGURE_MAP.csv`](../FIGURE_MAP.csv) (script ↔ inputs ↔ outputs mapping)

For the public release, notebooks are **archived and not maintained**, and may not reflect the current directory layout or exact figure-generation pipeline.
