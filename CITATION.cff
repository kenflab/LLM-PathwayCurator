abstract: >
  Enrichment interpretations invite plausible narratives. LLM-PathwayCurator
  transforms enrichment outputs into auditable, evidence-linked claims with
  redundancy-highlighting module mapping; across The Cancer Genome Atlas’s seven
  cohorts, it achieved qualified coverage of 0.66–0.80 under matched context but
  dropped to 0.20–0.42 under context swap and 0.20–0.30 after supporting-gene
  dropout, reflecting contract violations or weakened gene support. By
  transforming narratives into decision-grade claims with audit-gated
  abstention, it establishes a reproducible quality-assurance layer for omics
  interpretation.
