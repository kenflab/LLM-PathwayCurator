# LLM-PathwayCurator

Repository/package name: `llm_pathway_curator`

LLM-PathwayCurator transforms enrichment outputs into audited, typed pathway claims conditioned on study context, with calibrated abstention (PASS/ABSTAIN/FAIL). It does not propose a new enrichment test; it makes enrichment outputs decision-grade by auditing stability, evidence consistency, and context-conditioned claim validity.
